-- Define a data type 'Expr' which represents three kinds of expression:
-- binary operators (use 'BinOp' as a helper type) applied to two expressions,
-- numbers (use Int), and exponentiation x^n.
-- Note that since we consider expressions containing just a single variable,
-- x, your data type should *not* use 'String' or 'Char' anywhere, since this is
-- not needed.
